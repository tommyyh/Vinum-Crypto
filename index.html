              we are solving the interoperability between the metaverse and
              real-world, where NFTs will represent tickets or
              proof-of-ownership for assets in both worlds
            </p>
            <p>
              by pioneering the movement of real business to the metaverse. we
              want to achieve a new way of representing a real world brand with
              a real life product, in the new digital world.

              let us describe you the first concept of meta wine that our
              project Vinum is about to bring to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              we want to launch an NFT collection that will serve as proof of
              ownership of an exclusive and limited edition real asset that gets
              more valuable as time goes, as well as digital asset deployed in
              the metaverse.

            <p>
              In the long process of wine researching, we have found and decided
              to pick special, and unique place for our wine origination -
              Republic of Moldova, located in Eastern Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for us the NFT was a discovery, Moldavian wine will be the wine
              like no others ever presented to the world. The small country,
              unknown to the most, which has one of the best terrains for wine
              grapes cultivation, simply delighted us with its wine, culture and
              history.
